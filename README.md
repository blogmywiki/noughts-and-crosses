# Noughts and crosses

Inspired by reading Rodnay Zaks' 1980 book '6502 Games', I thought I'd have a go at coding some simple noughts and crosses ('tic tac toe') games in Python, as I don't think I've ever done this simple thing before.

In all versions, you make your move by entering the square number:
```
012
345
678
```

## ox.py

ox.py is just a game for 2 human players, so I could set up a simple user interface that spots when a player has won or if it's a draw.

##Â ox2.py

ox2.py is a game you play against the computer, but the human always goes first and the computer just picks the first free square, so it's super easy to beat.

## ox3.py

ox3.py uses something closer to Zaks' algorithm:

- You can choose who plays first, human or computer
- The computer scans each row, column and diagonal and assigns a weighting score to each square:
-- Sqaures already played get a weight of 0
-- Playable squares get a weight of 1
-- Potential winning squares get an extra weight of 6
-- Potential losing squares, in which the human could win, get an extra weight of 5
-- Squares in a line where the human has placed a O get an extra weighting of 1

The program then picks the square with the highest weighting number for its move.
